# Webscraper
 This is for a school assignment. And check if it is possible to npm install Bass4Nation/webscraper. Requirements: npm, git


## Getting Started
Note: This is a work in progress. Most of the code is not yet implemented.
#### Installation
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory. This will install all the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server and the website.
4. On the website, paste the URL of the website you want to scrape and click "Scrape". The scraped data will be displayed on the page/console and on the server at this moment. (This is just a test to see if the scraping works. And an example on how to use the scraper.)
   
#### Usage
    
1. Paste the URL of the website you want to scrape in the input field.
2. Click "Scrape".
3. The scraped data will be displayed on the page/console and on the server at this moment. 
4. You can also download the scraped data as a JSON file. (Not yet implemented)

#### Yet to be implemented
1. Downloading the scraped data as a JSON file.
2. Take screenshot of the website that is scraped.
3. Arrange the scraped data in a more readable format.
4. Possible to use this in other than Node.js/Next.js environments.
